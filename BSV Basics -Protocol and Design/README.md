# Introduction

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology introduced to the world in 2008. Since the early 1990s, technologists have sought to create a form of digital cash that allows fast, cheap, and reliable payments over the internet. While many early attempts failed, Bitcoin's innovative properties have enabled it to thrive as a global peer-to-peer payment system.

The internet has connected the globe in unprecedented ways, driving significant economic growth. However, the lack of a native way to send money directly over the internet without relying on trusted intermediaries has remained a critical gap. Bitcoin addresses this by enabling micropayments directly between peers, opening the door for an explosion of new applications. At its core, Bitcoin operates on a global ledger, providing unparalleled transparency and serving as a definitive source of truth.

This course introduces the **Bitcoin protocol**, the foundational system that powers this innovation. However, over time, different implementations of the protocol have emerged. Among these, the **BSV blockchain** uniquely preserves the original vision of Bitcoin as laid out in the whitepaper, offering unbounded scalability and a focus on utility as a global data ledger and payment system. Unlike other implementations that have deviated from this vision and failed to scale, the BSV blockchain stands out as the only implementation capable of fulfilling Bitcoin's original purpose.

This course is designed for those with little or no prior knowledge of Bitcoin and serves as a precursor to our **Bitcoin Theory** course. The Bitcoin Theory course provides a deep dive into the Bitcoin whitepaper and forms a complete understanding of the protocol. After completing this introductory course, we encourage you to continue to the Bitcoin Theory course stream for a more advanced exploration.

In this introductory course, you will be introduced to three main components of Bitcoin to build your foundational understanding of the system:

1. **The Ledger**
   * We will explore what is commonly referred to as the “blockchain” and the importance of the Bitcoin ledger as the backbone of the network.
2. **Coins and Transactions**
   * We will examine how coins are defined, how they are transferred between owners, and the process of "mining," which ensures data is written to the ledger through network nodes.
3. **Theory**
   * We will tie together these processes by reviewing key concepts from the Bitcoin whitepaper to solidify your understanding of the system.

Thanks for joining us—let’s dive in!
