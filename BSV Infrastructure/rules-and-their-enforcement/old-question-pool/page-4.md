1. What do Script Language Policies apply to?

Stack memory usage.&#x20;

The maximum length of a byte sequence considered a valid numeric value.&#x20;

Script execution.  ✓

All of the above.&#x20;

1. What happens to transactions which contain scripts that contain numeric values that are greater than that defined by the Numeric Value Policy?

They won’t be propagated across the P2P network or be included in a block.  ✓

They will be cached by nodes until a node capable of processing that transaction includes it into a block.&#x20;

They will be rejected as invalid.  ✓

They will be redefined to meet the maximum length of a byte sequence to be considered a valid numeric value.&#x20;

1. What does the Stack Memory Usage Policy limit?

The amount of memory consumable on the stacks.  ✓

The amount of transactions able to be processed simultaneously.&#x20;

The sum of the memory used by the stack and the memory used by the alt-stack.  ✓

The amount of stack memory allowed for the execution of the unlocking and locking script for an input.  ✓

1. If the execution of the unlocking and locking script for an input uses \_\_\_\_\_\_ than defined in the Stack Memory Usage Policy, then the transaction is \_\_\_\_\_\_.

less inputs, invalid&#x20;

more memory, rejected  ✓

less memory, invalid&#x20;

more memory, valid&#x20;

1. The value of Stack Memory Usage Policy must be \_\_\_\_\_\_ to the value of the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule.

automatically configured&#x20;

greater than or equal&#x20;

less than or equal  ✓

equal&#x20;

1. Nodes on the Bitcoin network are free to do what?

To connect or disconnect to any device, user or service.  ✓

To reject or shut down connections as they see fit.  ✓

To operate with different connection policies than other nodes.  ✓

To reject otherwise valid transactions or blocks without consequence.&#x20;

1. What can cause nodes to be automatically disconnected if they propagate invalid blocks or transactions?

Well connected node operators that are monitoring for malicious activities.&#x20;

Bitcoin node client conditional monitoring systems.  ✓

Nakamoto Consensus.&#x20;

All of the above.&#x20;

1. What is the local policy on the propagation of non-standard transactions after Genesis activation?

Non-standard transactions will be propagated across the network.  ✓

Non-standard transactions must meet the Stack Memory Usage Policy.&#x20;

Non-standard transactions will not be propagated across the network.&#x20;

Non-standard transaction minimum fee policy requires a higher value.&#x20;
