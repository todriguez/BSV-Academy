By each node entering them into their mem pool.&#x20;

By nodes generating a block header.&#x20;

Authorizing transactions.&#x20;

Timestamping transactions.  ✓

Delivering transactions.&#x20;

1. What must nodes collate, validate, process and store?

All blocks sent to them by other nodes.&#x20;

All actions taking place on the network in real-time.  ✓

The block header of every block leading back to the Genesis Block.&#x20;

Any transactions that are attempts to re-spend already spent outputs.&#x20;

1. How might a node effectively deal with valid transactions?

Enter them into the block header to create a hash puzzle for proof of work.&#x20;

Collect and store them.&#x20;

Assemble into blocks for possible addition to the chain.  ✓

Distribute the funds to the transaction’s recipient.&#x20;

1. What is Proof of Work a function of?

It is proof of a node operator’s investment in the network.  ✓

It is the mechanism by which transactions are determined to be valid or not.&#x20;

It is the process of placing transactions into a block.&#x20;

It is a way for nodes to validate the blocks they receive from other nodes.&#x20;

1. How does Proof of Work act as a gating function for nodes when building new blocks?

By ensuring each node has properly followed the block consensus rules in creating their block.&#x20;

By linking new blocks to the chain leading back to the original genesis block.&#x20;

By applying an up-front cost to a new block being proposed for validation by the network.  ✓

All of the above.&#x20;

**10. What does Proof of Work as a gating function incentivize?**

Honest blocks.&#x20;

By solving it, nodes are rewarded with freshly distributed bitcoins.&#x20;

The potential for profit incentivizes businesses to participate in Bitcoin mining.&#x20;

Its expense incentivizes network participants to put only honest blocks forward.  ✓

**11. What does Proof of Work allow for?**

It allows for transactions to be sent and received by users securely and prevents any attempts at double spending on the network.&#x20;

It allows for anyone with the adequate resources to operate a node, and to attempt to extend the chain of blocks.   ✓

It allows for the Bitcoin network to function as a small world network by creating dense connectivity between nodes.&#x20;

All of the above.&#x20;

**12. What is necessary for successful participation in the network?**

Successfully creating a transaction fee market based on network limitations.&#x20;

Accurate consensus on the economic limitations of the network.&#x20;

The most mining hardware.&#x20;

&#x20;Investment in viable infrastructure.  ✓

**13. The first step to run the network is which of the following?**

All nodes must find a proof-of-work which matches the difficulty target.&#x20;

New blocks are broadcast to all nodes.&#x20;

New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.  ✓

None of the above.&#x20;

**14. The second step to run the network is which of the following?**

Each transaction is entered into a block for validation.&#x20;

Each node collects valid transactions into a block.  ✓

Each node finds a difficult proof of work for its block.&#x20;

Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.&#x20;

**15. The third step to run the network is which of the following?**

Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.  ✓

New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.&#x20;

When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.&#x20;

Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.&#x20;

**16. The fourth step to run the network is which of the following?**

Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.&#x20;

When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.  ✓

Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.&#x20;

Each node finds a difficult proof of work for its block.&#x20;

**17. The fifth step to run the network is which of the following?**

Nodes accept the block only if all transactions are valid and not already spent.  ✓

Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.&#x20;

All nodes must find a proof-of-work which matches the difficulty target.&#x20;

When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.&#x20;

**18. The sixth step to run the network is which of the following?**

Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.&#x20;

Nodes with a valid block that is accepted by the network are rewarded with the disbursement of previously undistributed bitcoins along with the transaction fees contained within the block.&#x20;

Nodes express their acceptance of a block by working on creating the next block in the chain by including the accepted block's hash in is new block.  ✓

Other Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and the proof-of-work meets the difficulty target set by network consensus.&#x20;

**19. By following these instructions what are nodes incentivized to do?**

Scale the network efficiently.  ✓

Become extremely profitable.&#x20;

Create a transaction fee market based upon the economic limitations of the network.&#x20;
