All questions are multiple choice questions and there could be one or more possible correct answers.

1. What is being referred to in this passage from Section 5 of the Bitcoin white paper: “Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism”?

The collecting and time-stamping of transactions by nodes under a set of rules which are collectively enforced by building blocks on the longest valid chain.  ✓

The enforcement of Nakamoto consensus by refusing to participate in orphan races and only building upon valid blocks.&#x20;

Nodes are required to follow Nakamoto consensus or be cut off from the longest proof-of-work chain and risk wasting their hashpower.&#x20;

All of the above.&#x20;

1. What is the meaning of spontaneously in regards to nodes spontaneously forming a Small World Network?

Without any order.&#x20;

No central leadership or direction.  ✓

Quickly through a hub.&#x20;

Random luck.&#x20;

1. What happens to the network when nodes leave or are disconnected?

Nothing.  ✓

It can fracture the small world network.&#x20;

If enough nodes leave at the same time the network could stall.&#x20;

The network becomes less efficient.&#x20;

1. What does the Small World Network trend towards?

A Central Hub.&#x20;

A Complete Graph.&#x20;

A Near Complete Graph.  ✓

All of the above.&#x20;

1. Why do nodes spontaneously form a Small World Network?

The result of asymmetrical game theory.&#x20;

The incentive to quickly propagate transactions and blocks.  ✓

The rules force them to or they will be disconnected from the network.&#x20;

It is still unknown.&#x20;

1. What does decentralization in regards to the Bitcoin network mean?

That those which hold a copy of the ledger have a role in consensus.&#x20;

That decision making power is unnecessary.&#x20;

That individual nodes make the decisions through proof-of-work.  ✓

That infrastructure and leadership isn’t dependent on a single party.  ✓

1. Who controls nodes?

The regulatory environment that nodes operate within.&#x20;

Businesses and corporations.  ✓

The Bitcoin community.&#x20;

Whoever has the most hashpower.&#x20;

1. The requirement to  \_\_\_\_\_\_ in order to submit a block creates a fair barrier to participation in the consensus process, since only \_\_\_\_\_ can impact the network rules.

collect and organize transactions, valid transactions&#x20;

validate transactions, nodes&#x20;

show proof-of-work, valid blocks  ✓

be a node, blocks&#x20;

1. What role does altruism play in the network?

None.  ✓

It forms the basis for some of the incentives.&#x20;

The sharing of block data is mutually beneficial.&#x20;

It is the basis for many of the incentives.&#x20;

**10. Who has the right to agree or disagree about the enforcement of rules on the network?**

Nodes.  ✓

Users.&#x20;

No one.&#x20;

Only nodes that successfully build blocks.&#x20;

**11. Which nodes are rewarded the most long term?**

Those with close exchange ties.&#x20;

Those that protect the network altruistically.&#x20;

Those with effective resource management.  ✓

Those with dense network connectivity.&#x20;

**12. Which are strong incentives for nodes to have very low latency connections to nodes that are most likely to find a block?**

The First Seen Rule.  ✓

To be able to share and spread block information readily.  ✓

The potential for wasting proof-of-work on an already surpassed previous block hash.  ✓

The minimization of orphan blocks.  ✓
