| Payment channels are an under-utilised feature of the Bitcoin protocol.                                                                                                                        | Todd                                                                                      |
| A payment channel is a non-final transaction. A non-final transaction can be updated to a new valid state until its locktime expires at which point it is recorded permanently on the ledger.  | Use payment channel animation from Infrastructure course                                  |
| Payment channels are created when a transaction is submitted with a non-final nSequence value for an input and an nLocktime in the future.                                                     | Todd                                                                                      |
| Payment channels confer immense versatility as they can be created to operate any type of program, allowing for the implementation of sophisticated functionality.                             | Show a computer process happening inside a transaction as the sequence number increases.  |
| Understanding payment channels is crucial for a Bitcoin script engineer, as they serve as a valuable tool in their toolkit.                                                                    | Todd                                                                                      |
