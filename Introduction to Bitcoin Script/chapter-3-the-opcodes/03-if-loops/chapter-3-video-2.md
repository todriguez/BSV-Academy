| If loops are a vital part of Bitcoin script, allowing you to create branches in code that                                                                                                                                                                       | Todd                           |

| There are two opcodes that can trigger entry into an IF loop. These are:                                                                                                                                                                                        | Todd                           |
| OP\_IF and OP\_NOTIF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Show words on screen           |
| IF loops can also contain an 'ELSE branch' where the alternative outcome to the tested outcome is processed. IF loops can be nested to test multiple outcomes, for the creation of scripts enabling the emulation of case statements and ELSE-IF functionality. | Show Animation of IF/ELSE loop |
| These opcodes can be used to develop advanced functionality and are an essential part of the Bitcoin script engineer's toolbox.                                                                                                                                 | Todd                           |
