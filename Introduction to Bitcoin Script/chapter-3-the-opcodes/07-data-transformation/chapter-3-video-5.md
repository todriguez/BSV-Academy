| While the nodes on the BSV network have consistently advocated for no changes to the underlying Bitcoin protocol, there have been instances where this principle has been deviated from, and the following two opcodes serve as evident examples.         | Todd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| OP\_NUM2BIN and OP\_BIN2NUM, which replaced other opcodes, diverge from the original Bitcoin script and remain as the only active opcodes today that were not part of the originally released protocol.                                                   | <p>Show wiki opcode page and highlight NUM2BIN and BIN2NUM<br><a href="https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Opcodes_used_in_Bitcoin_Script#Data_Manipulation">https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Opcodes_used_in_Bitcoin_Script#Data_Manipulation</a></p> |
| OP\_NUM2BIN is utilized to pad numeric values to a specified length, commonly used when a mask of a particular size is required. However, it's important to exercise caution as this opcode zeroes the sign bit, potentially altering the original value. | Show a number being extended to match a mask, also show a negative number being changed to positive and extended                                                                                                                                          |
| OP\_BIN2NUM removes leading zeroes from a string, resulting in a minimally encoded numeric value placed at the top of the stack.                                                                                                                          | Show an extended number (e.g. 00000010ab314d19) being 'optimally encoded (e.g. 00000010ab314d19 -> 10ab314d19)                                                                                                                                            |
