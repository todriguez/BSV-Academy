| In this chapter we will take a detailed look at some simple script templates which can be used for wallets that require different account types.                                                                                             | Todd                                                                           |
|  These include:                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <p>Blank screen for text. <br>Show at top of screen:<br>Templates:</p>         |
| Pay to Public key scripts such as those commonly used in the very early days of the network                                                                                                                                                  | <p>Add text:</p><ol><li>Pay to Public Key (P2PK)</li></ol>                     |
| Pay to Hash Puzzle scripts, useful where simple, low overhead locking and unlocking is needed                                                                                                                                                | <p>Add text:</p><ol start="2"><li>Pay to Hash Puzzle (P2HP)</li></ol>          |
| Pay to Public Key Hash, the most widely used script template today                                                                                                                                                                           | <p>Add text:</p><ol start="3"><li>Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH)</li></ol>     |
| Pay to Multisignature, useful when creating accounts where multiple parties have access to tokens or funds                                                                                                                                   | <p>Add text:</p><ol start="4"><li>Pay to Multisignature (P2MS)</li></ol>       |
| Pay to Multisignature Hash, a version of a multisignature script that masks public keys until a spend event occurs                                                                                                                           | <p>Add text:</p><ol start="5"><li>Pay to Multisignature Hash (P2MSH)</li></ol> |
| And finally, a look at R-Puzzles, a technique that leverages the R-value in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm to provide an additional checking mechanism allowing two separate keys to be used in the same signature.          | <p>Add text:</p><ol start="6"><li>Pay to Public Key (P2RP)</li></ol>           |
| These techniques on their own provide for a multitude of use cases, however the engineer who understands these functions deeply will be able to blend and meld them  into powerfully useful transaction types for a variety of applications. | Todd                                                                           |
