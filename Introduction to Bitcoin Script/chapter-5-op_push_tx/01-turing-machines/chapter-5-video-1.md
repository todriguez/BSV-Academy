| Babbage's first implementation of a digital computer was the groundbreaking invention known as the Difference Engine. This remarkable device was capable of performing polynomial mathematics in the 1830s.                                                                                                                                                          | Show babbage Difference Engine                                                                                                         |

| In the context of Bitcoin, we can leverage the blockchain as the tape, creating transactions that evaluate information from a previous state to generate new outputs, effectively forming a state machine.                                                                                                                                                           | Show the tape morphing into blockchain tape with transactions                                                                          |
| In this chapter, we will explore a key technique called OP\_PUSH\_TX, which allows for the construction of complex functionality using Bitcoin script as a Turing-complete language. This technique empowers developers to push transactions onto the blockchain, enabling dynamic evaluation and the execution of advanced operations within the Bitcoin ecosystem. | Todd - At the end show OP\_PUSH\_TX on screen                                                                                          |
