| Regarding the core technologies in Bitcoin, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) stands as a relatively recent innovation in computer science                    | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
| <p>Elliptic curve signatures use the properties of the secp256k1<br>Elliptic curve within a massive range offering extensive applicability across a broad range of scenarios. </p> | Show the secp256k1 curve zooming out to show scale. see [https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Secp256k1](https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Secp256k1) |
| Digital signatures find widespread use across various applications                                                                                                                 | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
| and are legally recognized in most jurisdictions as equivalent to ink signatures on paper.                                                                                         | show someone signing paper                                                                                                                             |
| Digital signatures are generated using the private key of a public/private key pair and a specific message.                                                                        | Show a digital signature being generated                                                                                                               |
| To validate a digital signature, the validator requires both the message and the corresponding public key.                                                                         | Show a digital signature being checked against the message and the key                                                                                 |
| In the context of a Bitcoin transaction, the message used digital signatures                                                                                                       | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
| is constructed using components of the transaction and the outputs being spent as inputs.                                                                                          | Show a digital signature being made from a transaction                                                                                                 |
| This design ensures that nodes can validate messages without relying on external information beyond the transaction itself.                                                        | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
| Bitcoin employs digital signatures                                                                                                                                                 | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
| formatted in an extended version of the DER signature format.                                                                                                                      | Show DER packet - see chapter 4 animation 6                                                                                                            |
| This extended format includes a Sighash flag, granting the signing party precise control over which parts of the transaction are being signed.                                     | animation based on [https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/SIGHASH\_flags](https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/SIGHASH_flags)                             |
| Such granular control holds significance within a legal context.                                                                                                                   | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
| Digital signatures serve as a fundamental element of Bitcoin, and this chapter will showcase how these constructs can be utilized to create Turing-complete applications.          | Todd                                                                                                                                                   |
